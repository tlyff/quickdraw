# Machine Learning Project

This is a part of a Machine Learning project I did for the Machine Learning course at Télécom Paris, 2020-2021.

Using Keras, the goal was to find the most appropriate way to differentiate images of grapes from images of ants using SVM and Neural Networks. The first part on SVM was coded by my fellow student, and I coded the second part of this work, on Neural Networks.
